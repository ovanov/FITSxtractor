# FITSxtractor - The metadata extractor

With FITSxtractor, you can extract metadata from XML files (generated by FITS) and save them in a .cvs or .xlsx file by calling it from the command line.


The code is made for the XML tree structure that the Harvard tool 'FITS' outputs. See their [Website] (https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/home)

# Overview

The FITS metadata extractor was written to be implemented as a simplifaction tool for digital long term archiving workflows.

A key aspect in archiving is keeping track of the most usefull metadata while not overshooting with information. The extractor uses the vast extensive output, that FITS (File Information Tool Set) provides and saves out the common information.

## Usage

The following shows how to get and use FITSxtractor.

### Installation

    $ pip install FITSxtractor


If you would rather like to customize the code to your needs, grab a stable version under "Releases". All the files are extensively commented as well, in order to make the files more user firendly.

### Usage

When in a terminal specify:

    $ FITSxtracotr path_to_dir --output path_to_outputfile

The programm takes a directory populated with at least one (!) FITS xml output and takes an output as a positional argument. Accepted output formats are files ending with a .csv or .xlsx extension. If none are given, the program defaults to .xlsx.
